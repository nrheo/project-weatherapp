# Weather Mobile App

## Introduction

This is an iOS app that displays the live weather conditions of the city that the user inputs in the search bar. The background of the app changes according to the day/night time of the city. The weather information is provided by OpenWeather.

*This project was completed through the course offered by London App Brewery on Udemy.

## Technical Features

The app is compatible with dark mode and the user interface was designed using SwiftUI and UIKit. 

The CoreLocation feature was used to get the user's current location from the phone GPS. The app can automatically recognize the location of the user and display the live weather condition of the city the user is currently located in. 

I implemented the OpenWeather API to fetch live, global weather data and made HTTP requests with URLSession. Moreover, I parsed JSON with the native JSONDecoder.
